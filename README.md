# Audia - Save Your Playlists!
Audia is a simple command-line application that enables you to download all songs in a given playlist.

For example, a DJ would need to have their .mp3 files stored locally in order to mix music, but organizing music is difficult, and downloading songs individually is an extremely slow and tedious process. Using Audia, you can simply provide the URL to a Spotify playlist, and Audia will automatically find all of the songs, download them to a given location on your computer, and rename them in the format of "BPM - Artist - Title".

## Usage
```
audia.exe -url <URL of your playlist> -destination <The location on disk where you'd like your music to be saved>
```
